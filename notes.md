   * wc - prints the number of bytes, characters, words and lines for the indicated files
   * find - searches and prints the paths of files and/or directories whose names match the indicated patterns (use walkdir and regex libs, use iterators)
   * grep - finds and prints lines containing the indicated text/pattern from the indicated files/paths
